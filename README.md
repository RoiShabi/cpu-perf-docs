## The Story of CPU 

If there is one thing we use as much as oxygen these days, is CPU. It is all around us: our computer, our phone, smart TVs, even our cars. In general, it's a chip which does simple math things and communicate with other electronic devices. CPU is not the only hardware capable of those things, but it is programmable, means you can create logics to run on the CPU without the need of production lines. Since everyone have CPU in their PC or phone, One can create his logic and make it run almost everywhere.

## CPU Main Components

In general, CPU contains 3 components: Control Unit, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), I/O interfaces.

### Control Unit

The control unit is the circuitry which translates machine code to electrical signals for the inner components, it also wires the ALU results to I/O interfaces and vice versa.

### ALU

ALU is the unit doing the bitwise math operations. It adds, subtracts, XORs, NOTs etc.

### I/O Interfaces

Those are units within the processor, which interact with main memory, other processors, hard disks, monitors and so on.
